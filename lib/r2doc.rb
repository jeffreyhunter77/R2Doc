# It exists as an easy mechanism to set up the document generator for use
# under RDoc v1.0.1 (e.g. +require 'r2doc'+).  The only work that
# actually needs to be done is to include this directory in +$:+.  That's
# done automatically by gem when this file is required.  The remaining
# code is loaded by rdoc itself when it's run.
